```

3. View the HTML report in your browser (after generation)

```bash

```

## Note on implementation:

1. In real application, the server returns the correct response. So I use the mock response as is to display results without filtering for items that really contains keyword.

2. When handle clearing input by clicking clear button and select suggestion from the the suggestions dropdown, I use onMouseDown instead of onClick (because of the order in which events are fires).

- When we click on ClearButton / SuggestionItem, the `blur` event on SearchInput is triggered, which set the `isInputFocused` state to `false`
- The ClearButton / SuggestionsDropdown is applied `visibility: hidden` style. So the `click` event will not fired on those elements.
- But the `mousedown` event fires before the `blur` event. That's why I have to listen to it.
